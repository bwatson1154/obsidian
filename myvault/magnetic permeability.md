Different materials have different *magnetization* properties. Physicists use the *magnetic permeability* $\mu$ as a quantity to represent the magnetization properties of a given material.

In a vacuum, a universal constant called the *magnetic permeability of free space* $\mu_{0}$ is used. The magnetic permeability of free space is defined:
$$\mu_{0}= 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \text{ henry per meter (H/m).}$$
For other mediums, the magnetic permeability of free space is replaced with the magnetic permeability $\mu$ of the material in which $\mathbf{B}$ is being observed. The majority of materials are *nonmagnetic*, meaning they exhibit a magnetic permeability $\mu=\mu_{0}$. For ferromagnetic materials, such as iron and nickel, $\mu$ can be much larger than $\mu_{0}$. Similarly to relative permittivity, the magnetic permeability $\mu$ can be defined
$$\mu=\mu_{\text{r}}\mu_{0}\quad \text{(H/m),}$$
where $\mu_{\text{r}}$ is a dimensionless quantity called the *relative magnetic permeability* of the material.

The parameters of [[electrical permittivity]] $\varepsilon$, magnetic permeability $\mu$, and [[conductivity]] $\sigma$ are often referred to as the *constitutive parameters* of a material. A medium is said to be *homogeneous* if its constitutive parameters are constant throughout the medium.
