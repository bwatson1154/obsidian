The Biot-Savart law relates the [[magnetic flux density]] $\mathbf{B}$ at a point in space to the current $I$ in a conductor.

In the situation of a very long current-carrying wire residing in free space, the magnetic flux density $\mathbf{B}$ induced by a constant current $I$ flowing in the $z$-direction is given by
$$\mathbf{B}=\mathbf{\hat{\Phi}}\dfrac{\mu_{0}I}{2\pi r}\quad \text{(T),}$$
where $r$ is the radial distance from the current and $\mathbf{\hat{\Phi}}$ is an azimuthal unit vector expressing the fact that the [[magnetic field]] direction is tangential to the circle surrounding the current. The magnetic field is measured in Tesla $(\text{T})$, named after Nikola Tesla (1856-1943). The quantity $\mu_{0}$ is called the *[[magnetic permeability]] of free space*.
