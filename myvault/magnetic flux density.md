Magnetic flux density, represented by $\mathbf{B}$, is the most common way to represent the presence of a magnetic field in physics. The magnetic field lines around magnetic objects represent the magnetic flux density.

The magnetic flux density is related to the current $I$ in a conductor by the [[Biot-Savart law]], named after two prominent scientists in the subject of [[magnetism]].
