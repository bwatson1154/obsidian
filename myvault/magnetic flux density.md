Magnetic flux density, represented by $\mathbf{B}$, is the most common way to represent the presence of a magnetic field in physics. The magnetic field lines around magnetic objects represent the magnetic flux density.

The magnetic flux density is related to the current $I$ in a conductor by the [[Biot-Savart law]], named after two prominent scientists in the subject of [[magnetism]].

The quantities of the magnetic flux density $\mathbf{B}$ and the [[magnetic field intensity]] $\mathbf{H}$, constitute one of two fundamental pairs of electromagnetic fields, and are related through $\mu$:
$$\mathbf{B}=\mu \mathbf{H}.$$
