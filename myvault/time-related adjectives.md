1. *static*
	- a quantity that does not change with time
	- the term *dc* (direct current) is often used as a synonym for static to describe currents and other electromagnetic quantities
2. *dynamic*
	- a quantity that varies with time
	- conveys no specific information about the character of variation
3. *waveform*
	- a plot of the magnitude profile of a quantity as a function of time
4. *periodic*
	- a quantity is periodic if its waveform repeats itself at a regular interval namely its period $T$
	- examples include sinusoids and square, triangle, and saw waves
	- application of the Fourier series will allow any periodic waveform to be expressed as the sum of an infinite series of sinusoids
5. *sinusoidal*
	- also called *ac* (alternating current)
	- a quantity that varies sinusoidally (or cosinusoidally) with time
