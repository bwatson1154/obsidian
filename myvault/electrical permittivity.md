Fields induced by electric charges behave in different ways in different
mediums, such as through a vacuum, or through metal. This difference in behavior is due to electric charges polarizing the atoms making up different materials, causing each atom to gain an [[electric dipole]] moment.

To account for the effects from fields induced by the dipole behavior of different materials, physicists introduced the concept of electrical permittivity. Electrical permittivity is a quantity that represents how much a given medium that electric charges pass through impedes the electric field.

In a vacuum, a universal constant called the *electrical permittivity of free space* is used. The value of the electrical permittivity of free space is defined
$$\varepsilon_{0}=8.854\times 10^{-12} \text{ farad per meter (F/m).}$$
For other mediums, the permittivity of free space $\varepsilon_{0}$ is replaced by $\varepsilon$, where $\varepsilon$ is the permittivity of the material in which the electric field is measured. Often, $\varepsilon$ is expressed in the form
$$\varepsilon=\varepsilon_{\text{r}}\varepsilon_{0}\text{ (F/m)}$$
where $\varepsilon_{\text{r}}$ is a dimensionless quantity called the *relative permittivity* or *dielectric constant* of the material.
