The electric field is the force field created by the presence of an [[electric charge]]. Physicists define the existence of an *electric field intensity* $\mathbf{E}$ due to a charge $q$ as
$$\mathbf{E}=\mathbf{\hat{R}} \frac{q}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}R^2}\quad \text{(V/m)} \quad \text{(in free space),}$$
where $R$ is the distance between the charge and the observation point, and $\mathbf{\hat{R}}$ is the radial unit vector pointing away from the charge.

If any point charge $q'$ is present in an electric field $\mathbf{E}$, the point charge will experience an [[electric force]] acting on it equal to $\mathbf{F}_{\text{e}}=q'\mathbf{E}$.
