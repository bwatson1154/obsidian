Dynamics is the third and more general branch of electromagnetics, and involves *time-varying fields* induced by time-varying sources, that is, currents and associated charge densities.

An important property of dynamics is that *a time-varying [[electric field]] will generate a time-varying [[magnetic field]], and vice versa*.

The term dynamic is used in the context of [[time-related adjectives]].
