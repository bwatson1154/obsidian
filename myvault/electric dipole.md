Consider a material composed of a lattice of atoms. The atoms are electrically
neutral, with a positively charged center made of protons and neutrons, and a
negatively charged electron cloud surrounding them. When a positive point charge
is placed on the material, the electron cloud of each of the surrounding atoms
is attracted to it, thus changing each cloud's center of symmetry with respect
to the nucleus of each atom. This results in one pole of an atom becoming
positively charged relative to the other pole. A polarized atom like this is
known as an electric dipole, and the distortion process is called
*polarization*.
- The degree of polarization depends on the distance from the point charge to the atom.
- The orientation of the dipole is determined by the polarity of the point charge.
- If the point charge is positive, the negative pole of the atom will point along the line connecting it to the atom.
- If the point charge is negative, the positive pole of the atom will point towards it.
The net result of the polarization process is that the electric fields of the dipoles of the atoms (or molecules) tend to counteract the field due to the point charge. Consequently, the electric field at any point in the material is different from the field that would have been induced by the point charge in the absence of the material. This difference in behavior of the fields depending on material leads to the concept of [[electrical permittivity]] in electromagnetics.
