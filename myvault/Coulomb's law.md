Coulomb's law is the result of the work of French scientist Charles Augustin de Coulomb (1736-1806). The SI unit for [[electric charge]], the Coulomb ($\text{C}$), is named after him.

Coulomb's law is described by three important properties:
1. Two like charges repel one another, whereas two charges of opposite polarity attract one another.
2. The attractive/repellent force acts along the line connecting the two charges.
3. The strength of the force is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of the two charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
Coulomb's law can be described mathematically as
$$\mathbf{F}_{\text{e}21}=\hat{\mathbf{R}}_{12}\dfrac{q_{1}q_{2}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}R^2_{12} } \quad \text{(N)} \quad \text{(in free space)}$$
$\mathbf{F}_{\text{e}21}$ is called the *electric force*.
