The law of conservation of [[electric charge]] states that the net electric charge can neither be created nor destroyed.

If a volume contains $n_{\text{p}}$ protons and $n_{\text{e}}$ electrons, then the total charge is
$$q=n_{\text{p}}e-n_{\text{e}}e=(n_{\text{p}}-n_{\text{e}})e \quad \text{(C)}.$$
Even if some of the protons were to combine with an equal number of electrons to form neutrons or other elementary particles, the net charge $q$ remains unchanged. In real matter, quantum mechanical laws do not allow protons inside nuclei and electrons to combine.
