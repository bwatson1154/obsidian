The conductivity $\sigma$ of a material, measured in siemens per meter $\text{(S/m)}$, characterizes the ease with which charges can move freely in a material.
- If $\sigma=0$, the charges do not move more than atomic distances and the material is said to be a *perfect dielectric*
- If $\sigma=\infty$, the charges can move freely throughout the material, which is then called a *perfect conductor*

The parameters of [[electrical permittivity]] $\varepsilon$, [[magnetic permeability]] $\mu$, and conductivity $\sigma$ are often referred to as the *constitutive parameters* of a material. A medium is said to be *homogeneous* if its constitutive parameters are constant throughout the medium.
