- The electromagnetic force is the second strongest of the four fundamental forces
- Its strength is on the order of $10^{-2}$ that of the strong nuclear force
- It is the dominant force in *microscopic systems*, such as atoms and molecules
The electromagnetic force consists of an electrical component $\mathbf{F}_{\text{e}}$ and a magnetic component $\mathbf{F}_{\text{m}}$. The electrical force $\mathbf{F}_{\text{e}}$ is similar to the gravitational force, but with two major differences.
1. The source of the electrical field is electric charge, not mass.
2. Though both types of fields vary inversely as the square of the distance from their sources, electric charges may have positive or negative polarity, resulting in a force that can be attractive or repulsive.
