The principle of linear superposition states that the total vector [[electric field]] at a point in space due to a system of point [[electric charge|charges]] is equal to the vector sum of the electric fields at that point due to the individual charges.

Put simply, the electric field from any number of charges is simply the sum of the individual fields from each charge.
