All matter contains a mixture of neutrons, positively charged protons, and negatively charged electrons. The fundamental quantity of charge is that of a single electron. Usually denoted by the letter $e$. Electric charge is measured in units of Coulombs ($\text{C}$). The magnitude of $e$ is
$$e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \quad \text{(C)}$$
The charge of a single electron is $q_{\text{e}}=-e$ and that of a proton is equal in magnitude but opposite in polarity: $q_{\text{p}}=e$.

Electric charge has two important properties:
1. The [[law of conservation of electric charge]]
2. The [[principle of linear superposition]]
